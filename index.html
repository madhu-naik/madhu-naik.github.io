What is Wildpeace? 

<p style ="color:white">
The true answer is: we do not know for sure. Wildpeace is the name of a being, an energy, a place, an experience, a truth, a teacher. 
To us Wildpeace is alive. It instructs our value systems, our aspirations, our goals, our expectations, our actions and the way we listen, 
see and live in this world. We serve Wildpeace. In return, Wildpeace enriches our lives with colors, with vibrancy, with excitement,
 adventure, strength, wonder, humor, humility and joy. It especially gifts us endless growth and deeply immersive participation with 
 all aspects of our lives. Wildpeace helps us come home. 

It does not matter what Wildpeace means to us, because the answer is wild - it means different things to different people, at 
different times. What matters is, do you feel something when you hear “Wildpeace”? If there is something about it that calls to you, 
that makes you want to know a little bit more, then there is something here for you.
