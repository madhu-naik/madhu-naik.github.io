The true answer is: we do not know for sure. Wildpeace is the name of a being, an energy, a place, an experience, a truth, a teacher. <br>
To us Wildpeace is alive. It instructs our value systems, our aspirations, our goals, our expectations, our actions and the way we listen, <br>
see and live in this world. We serve Wildpeace. In return, Wildpeace enriches our lives with colors, with vibrancy, with excitement,<br>
 adventure, strength, wonder, humor, humility and joy. It especially gifts us endless growth and deeply immersive participation with <br>
 all aspects of our lives. Wildpeace helps us come home. <br>
<br>
It does not matter what Wildpeace means to us, because the answer is wild - it means different things to different people, at <br>
different times. What matters is, do you feel something when you hear “Wildpeace”? If there is something about it that calls to you, <br>
that makes you want to know a little bit more, then there is something here for you. <br>
